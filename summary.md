### Methodology
- Trade-level data was aggregated to daily metrics per trader
- Market sentiment was aligned at a daily level
- Performance (PnL, win rate) and behavior (frequency, long bias) were compared across sentiment regimes
- Traders were segmented based on frequency and consistency

---

### Key Findings
1. **Performance Volatility**
   - Daily PnL volatility is significantly higher during Fear periods, indicating unstable market conditions.

2. **Behavioral Shift**
   - Traders place fewer but larger trades during Fear days.
   - Trade frequency and long bias increase during Greed periods.

3. **Trader Segments**
   - Frequent traders outperform infrequent traders during Greed days.
   - Consistent traders show smaller drawdowns during Fear periods.

### Actionable Strategies
1. During **Fear** days:
   - Reduce trade frequency
   - Focus on high-confidence setups only

2. During **Greed** days:
   - Increase activity selectively for consistent traders
   - Monitor long exposure to control downside risk

### Conclusion
Market sentiment strongly impacts both trader behavior and performance. Incorporating sentiment-aware rules can help reduce drawdowns and improve overall trading outcomes.
